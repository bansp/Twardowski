# Twardowski

Currently contains a free-standing TEI header for a PDF scan of "O czynnościach i wytworach" by Kazimierz Twardowski. The header was created in the context of a range of projects conducted as part of Wioletta Miśkiewicz's seminar "Humanistyka Cyfrowa - Projekty, Ludzie, Teoria" (3501-S-HUMCYFR-OG) at Digital Economy Lab (DELab), at the University of Warsaw.
